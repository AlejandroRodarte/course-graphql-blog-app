# 1. Type definitions
# inside the template string goes GraphQL code

# type Query: define a query we can make
# type <Name>: define a custom type with fields

# type User defines how the custom 'User' model is structured
# the 'me' query allows to return a User model

# the 'Post' type is a custom object with id, title, body and published flag
# 'post' query returns a post

# operation argument are attached at the right of the query name as if it was a function

# the 'users' query returns an array of the 'User' custom type that matches the 'User' type definition
# and it accepts a query string (optional)

# the 'posts' query returns an array of 'Post' custom types and accepts an optional query string

# many posts are associated with one user: to associate a post with a user, declare a new field in the 
# Post type definition which will be of type User

# the 'User' type definiton has now a 'posts' fields which will hold an array of Posts that were created by a user

# the 'Comment' type definition with id and text required fields
# added a 'comments' query which returns an array of comment custom types

# added to the 'Comment' type an 'author' field that holds the User that wrote such Comment
# added to the 'User' type a 'comments' field that holds an array of Comment objects that the User wrote

# added to the 'Comment' type a 'post' field that holds the Post object that owns that comment
# added to the 'Post' type a 'comments' field that holds the Comments related to that Post

# type Mutation: declare all operations to create/update/delete data
# createUser creates a user based on a name, email and age
# createPost creates a post based on title, body, published flag and author id
# createComment creates a comment based on the text, author id and post id

# CreateUserInput input type that represents all scalar types required to add a new user
# CreatePostInput input type that represents all scalar types required to add a new post
# CreateCommentInput input type that represents all scalar types required to add a new comment

# deleteUser to delete a user based on its id, also delete all posts made by it and its comments
# deletePost to delete a post based on its id and all of its comments
# deleteComment to delete a comment based on its id

# updateUser to update user information by id
# updatePost to update post information by id
# updateComment to update comment information by id

# UpdateUserInput the same as CreateUserInput but with all fields optional
# UpdatePostInput the same as CreatePostInput but with all fields optional (except author)
# UpdateCommentInput the same as CreateCommentInput but with all fields optional (except author and post)

# type Subscription: setup subscriptions
# count subscription returns an integer

# comments to listen for comments in a particular post
# post to listen for newly created posts

# PostSubscriptionPayload as a type that contains the post and the mutation operation
# CommentSubscriptionPayload as a type that contains the comment and the mutation operation

# added password to user

# AuthPayload type returns a user and an auth token
# now createUser returns AuthPayload
